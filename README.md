### Project 1 - Twitter
Using skills learned in [CISC472](https://websec.prof.ninja/) create a DIY twitter site hosted on Firebase.

### Write Up

This has taught me a lot! I am so used to having a course assignment give me a step-by-step to create projects and this was nothing like that. 
As nerve-wracking as a “go make this” sort of assignment is, I learned more about my work style and pushed myself to create something that I could be proud of and grow from.

Developing an understanding and acceptance of Javascript quirks. 
- I ran into some weird things that were explained as “just js stuff”
- I assumed that security rules were set in stone and there was a standard for everything but I loved learning about how robust or crappy you could make your rules. 
- Having a backend/database always interested me because I didn’t know how it worked. Firebase makes it super easy to implement and I have already started creating small projects using it!

AHA Moments
- CSS craziness! I looked up a lot of tutorials and realized that the language I hated so much because I didn’t know why things worked/didn’t work actually makes a good amount of sense.
- Hosting and grabbing information from a database. I’ve made projects in the past without a database and I didn’t know how easy it would be to do. I thought you would have to set up a server yourself and create something extremely secure. Technically we did –– but firebase made it super easy and now I want to implement this with countless projects.
- JavaScript is a bit easier to use now, but I think I still need to deal with some more weird quirks before I actually start to like it.
